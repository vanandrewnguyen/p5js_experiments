# p5js_experiments
A series of short sketches using p5.js to make generative artworks. Reformatted from my p5.js library.
This was a series of experiments I made in teaching myself basic javascript. 

The original repo for all my p5.js experiments can be found here: https://editor.p5js.org/vanandrew/sketches
Much of the code however is uncommented and unformatted.
